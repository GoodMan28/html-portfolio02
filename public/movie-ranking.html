<hr/>

<h3>Lakshya</h3>

<p>
Best motivational movie for a person having a clear goal to become an officer in the Indian Army. Undoubltabely a cult
</p> 

<h3>The Legend of Bhagat Singh</h3>

<p>
One can value and appreciate the importance of the sacrifice of our freedom fighters and their respected parents who sacrificed their children
for the nation. After seeing the movie you will be speechless and respect the freedom we enjoy.
</p>

<h3>The Railway Men</h3>

<p>
This is not a movie but a show. You can respect the professionalism and patritism of the railway employees and at the same time will be filled with sorrow after seeing people getting seperated from their families
